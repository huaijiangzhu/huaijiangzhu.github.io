I am a PhD student at the [New York University Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu), advised by [Ludovic Righetti](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ludovic-righetti) at the [Machines in Motion Laboratory](https://wp.nyu.edu/machinesinmotion/). Prior to joining NYU Tandon, I received my bachelor's and master's degree in Electrical Engineering from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de), Germany.

My research interests include machine learning, control theory, and their applications to robotics. In particular, I would like to develop algorithms allowing robots to robustly apply contact forces to the external world, so that they can move freely and operate safely among us.
