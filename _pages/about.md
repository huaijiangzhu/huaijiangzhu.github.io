I am a PhD student at the [New York University Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu), advised by [Ludovic Righetti](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ludovic-righetti) at the [Machines in Motion Laboratory](https://wp.nyu.edu/machinesinmotion/). My research interests include machine learning, control theory, and their applications to robotics. In particular, I would like to develop algorithms allowing robots to robustly apply contact forces to the external world, so that they can move freely and operate safely among us.

Prior to joining NYU Tandon, I received my bachelor's and master's degree in Electrical Engineering from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de). I also spent a year at the [Autonomous Motion Department](http://am.is.tuebingen.mpg.de) headed by [Stefan Schaal](https://am.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/sschaal) of the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de) conducting my master's thesis. Under the supervision of [Franziska Meier](https://am.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/fmeier), [Jeannette Bohg](https://am.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/jbohg) and [Ludovic Righetti](https://www.is.mpg.de/~lrighetti), I worked on associating sensor traces with motion primitives for robust robot grasping.
